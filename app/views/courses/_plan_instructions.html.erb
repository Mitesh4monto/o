<p class="boxed">A course plan is comprised of activities.  They can be worked on simultaneously (e.g. exercising and dieting for a weight loss course) or sequentially (e.g. 12 step program).
	By default all activities are simultaneous.  For sequential steps first create an activity and then add an activity to the sequence.</p>
